## **Depth First Search**
Depth first Search or Depth first traversal is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.

**Algorithm :**
A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:

1. Visited
2. Not Visited

The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

The DFS algorithm works as follows:

1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
2. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited
 list to the top of the stack.
4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

#### Psuedo code
```
DFS(G, u)
    u.visited = true
    for each v ∈ G.Adj[u]
        if v.visited == false
            DFS(G,v)
     
init() {
    For each u ∈ G
        u.visited = false
     For each u ∈ G
       DFS(G, u)
}
```
